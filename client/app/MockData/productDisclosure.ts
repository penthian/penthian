        "BitStake is a key that unlocks the door to the world of real estate investing. It’s a platform where you can buy and sell fractions of properties, called BITS. Imagine you want to invest in a big building, but you don’t have enough money to buy an apartment unit or the whole thing. With BitStake, you can still own a fraction of an apartment in that building by buying the BITS listed on BitStake."
