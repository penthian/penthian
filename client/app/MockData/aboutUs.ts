I’ve worked in real estate and hospitality long enough to see the gaps up close. Developers with great buildings they can’t fully sell. Business owners ready to step back but with no one to take over. And everyday people: hard-working, ambitious, who want to invest in property or businesses but are locked out because the buy-in is just too high.",
